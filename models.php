  <h2>  Swincar</h2>
  <p>

Swincar is a vehicle with exceptional road capabilities whose only comparison could be some ATV that to achieve the same performance must be motorized and noisy.

Imagine a mechanical spider on wheels ... ..

Swincar takes the concept of fully independent suspension to a whole new planet, incorporating the tilting of the driver's cell to keep its pilot vertical while scaling.

The kinematic allows the inclination in turn, correcting tilt and the most extreme crosses axle.

Each wheel, all steered, is powered by its own electric motor - arriving with either 1 or 1.5 kW units and receive its independent suspensions at each of their ends.

  <h2>  Swincar e-Spider</h2>
  <p>

The Swincar e-Spider works with gravity and centrifugal force and like a pendulum has a natural balance which gives a sense of serenity to every journey.

The wheels always stay in contact with the ground on the steepest inclines and as you turn and corner even on an adverse camber.

The four driving and steering wheels, combined with a very low center of gravity, provide a lively drive experience combined with traction and safety.

When going downhill, the very safe motor brake recharges the recyclable, safe and very durable Lithium-Iron batteries.

The battery power and life mean independence and long journeys, even over difficult terrain.
